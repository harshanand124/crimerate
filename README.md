# Crime Rate Prediction

This project predicts crime rates based on various socio-economic factors using machine learning techniques. With a simple, user-friendly web interface powered by **Streamlit**, users can input data to predict potential crime rates. The project is built using **scikit-learn** for the machine learning pipeline and **Linear Regression** for the model.

## Features
- Streamlit Interface**: User-friendly interface for inputting data and viewing predictions.
- Machine Learning Model**: Predicts crime rate based on socio-economic factors.
- Pipeline with scikit-learn**: Streamlined data preprocessing and model training.
- Data Visualization**: Visualize prediction results.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Navigate to the project directory**
  
3. **Install the required packages**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    > Note: Ensure Python 3.7+ and `pip` are installed. The `requirements.txt` file includes all necessary packages, including `streamlit`, `scikit-learn`, and other dependencies.

## Usage

1. **Run the Streamlit app**
    
2. **Use the Interface**
    - Open your browser and go to the URL shown in your terminal (default is `http://localhost:8501`).
    - Enter the values for the socio-economic factors you want to test.
    - Click "Predict" to see the crime rate prediction.

## How it Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The pipeline handles data preprocessing tasks, such as scaling numerical features and encoding categorical ones.
   - Preprocessing steps are defined using `sklearn` pipelines for consistency and simplicity.

2. **Model**:
   - The model is a **Linear Regression** model, which predicts the crime rate based on the features input by the user.
   - The pipeline ensures data flows smoothly from preprocessing to prediction.

3. **Streamlit Interface**:
   - The app uses Streamlit to create an interactive interface where users can input various features and get predictions in real-time.

## Sample Dataset

To train the model, you may use publicly available crime data, such as the UCI Machine Learning Repository's **Communities and Crime Data Set**. Preprocess the dataset according to the project requirements.
